# Recipe_Manager
Simple recipe manager that can relate the recipes and the ingredientes  into a profile to export a week of meals, also export a Shopping List grouped by Aisle. Further I would love to add some other features. I did not find very quickly some app that could do this without paying and I was thinking that it's not that of a hard thing so I started this project, then I found the Paprika recipe manager and found out they have these features and others, but, I hope this project could help somebody else as well as me, plus it's free to use and open source so anybody can add their features.
